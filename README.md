# My Mission

My goal with every data-driven project is to take in seemingly meaningless and unorganized data, transform it into something meaningful and provide actionable insights to the team.

#My Projects

Over the past 2 years I have spent the majority of my time outside of studying working on projects for Intel along with dedicating a small portion of my time to analyzing market data to find discrepancies and patterns that can be exploited.

##Intel Projects ~(Generalized for NDA purposes)~

**Chip Security Visualization & Query Interface**: Custom visualization tool that takes in raw data on internal chip security, organizes the data and provides an easy inteface for querying the data along with visualizing it.

**Chip Security Discrepancy Identifier**: Interface that allows architects to quickly and easily identify discrepancies within the security of chips. 

**RTL Introspection Program**: A introspection algorithm that looks inside chip's RTL searching automatically searching for specific parameters providing hundred's of thousands of important peices of data that would be impossible to find by hand.
